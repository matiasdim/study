`Problem D. Cut Tiles`_
=======================

Problem
-------
Enzo is doing renovation for his new house. The most difficult part is to buy
exactly the right number of tiles. He wants **N** tiles of different sizes. Of
course they have to be cut from the tiles he bought. All the required tiles are
square. The lengths of side of the tiles are |2S1|, |2S2|, ..., |2SN|. He can
only buy a lot of tiles sized **M**\*\ **M**, and he decides to only cut tiles
parallel to their sides for convenience. How many tiles does he need to buy?

.. |2S1| raw:: html

    <b>2<sup>S<sub>1</sub></sup></b>

.. |2S2| raw:: html

    <b>2<sup>S<sub>2</sub></sup></b>

.. |2SN| raw:: html

    <b>2<sup>S<sub>N</sub></sup></b>

Input
-----
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases: **T**. **T** lines
follow. Each line start with the number **N** and **M**, indicating the number
of required tiles and the size of the big tiles Enzo can buy. **N** numbers
follow: |S1|, |S2|, ... |SN|, showing the sizes of the required tiles.

.. |S1| raw:: html

    <b>S<sub>1</sub></b>

.. |S2| raw:: html

    <b>S<sub>2</sub></b>

.. |SN| raw:: html

    <b>S<sub>N</sub></b>

Output
------
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the
test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of the big tiles Enzo
need [sic] to buy.

Limits
------
1 ≤ |2Sk| ≤ **M** ≤ 2^31-1.
