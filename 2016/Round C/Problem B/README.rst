`Problem B. Safe Squares`_
==========================

Problem
-------
Codejamon trainers are actively looking for monsters, but if you are not a
trainer, these monsters could be really dangerous for you. You might want to
find safe places that do not have any monsters!

Consider our world as a grid, and some of the cells have been occupied by
monsters. We define a *safe square* as a grid-aligned **D** × **D** square of
grid cells (with **D** ≥ 1) that does not contain any monsters. Your task is to
find out how many safe squares (of any size) we have in the entire world.

Input
-----
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test
cases follow. Each test case starts with a line with three integers, **R**,
**C**, and **K**. The grid has **R** rows and **C** columns, and contains **K**
monsters. **K** more lines follow; each contains two integers **R**\ |i| and
**C**\ |i|, indicating the row and column that the i-th monster is in. (Rows
are numbered from top to bottom, starting from 0; columns are numbered from
left to right, starting from 0.)

.. |i| raw:: html

    <b><sub>i</sub></b>

Output
------
For each test case, output one line containing ``Case #x: y``, where ``x`` is
the test case number (starting from 1) and ``y`` is the the total number of
safe zones for this test case.

Limits
------
1 ≤ **T** ≤ 20.

(**R**\ |i|, **C**\ |i|) ≠ (**R**\ |j|, **C**\ |j|) for i ≠ j. (No two monsters
are in the same grid cell.)

0 ≤ **R**\ |i| < **R**, i from 1 to **K**

0 ≤ **C**\ |i| < **C**, i from 1 to **K**

.. |j| raw:: html

    <b><sub>j</sub></b>

Small dataset
-------------
1 ≤ **R** ≤ 10.

1 ≤ **C** ≤ 10.

0 ≤ **K** ≤ 10.

Large dataset
-------------
1 ≤ **R** ≤ 3000.

1 ≤ **C** ≤ 3000.

0 ≤ **K** ≤ 3000.

    2 4
    2 9
    2 10
    3 4
    3 10

The grid of sample case #1 is:

| ``0 0 0``
| ``0 0 0``
``0 1 0``

Here, 0 represents a cell with no monster, and 1 represents a cell with a
monster. It has 10 safe squares: 8 1x1 and 2 2x2.

The grid of sample case #2 is:

| ``0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1``
| ``1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0``
| ``1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1``
``0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1``

Note that sample case #2 will only appear in the Large dataset. It has 51 safe
squares: 32 1x1, 13 2x2, 5 3x3, and 1 4x4.
