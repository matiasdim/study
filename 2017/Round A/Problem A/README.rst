`Problem A. Square Counting`_
=============================

Problem
-------
Mr. Panda has recently fallen in love with a new game called Square Off, in
which players compete to find as many different squares as possible on an
evenly spaced rectangular grid of dots. To find a square, a player must
identify four dots that form the vertices of a square. Each side of the square
must have the same length, of course, but it does not matter what that length
is, and the square does not necessarily need to be aligned with the axes of the
grid. The player earns one point for every different square found in this way.
Two squares are different if and only if their sets of four dots are different.

Mr. Panda has just been given a grid with **R** rows and **C** columns of dots.
How many different squares can he find in this grid? Since the number might be
very large, please output the answer modulo 10\ :sup:`9` + 7 (1000000007).

Input
-----
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** lines
follow. Each line has two integers **R** and **C**: the number of dots in each
row and column of the grid, respectively.

Output
------
For each test case, output one line containing ``Case #x: y``, where ``x`` is
the test case number (starting from 1) and ``y`` is the number of different
squares can be found in the grid.

Limits
------
1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.

Small dataset
-------------
| 2 ≤ **R** ≤ 1000.
| 2 ≤ **C** ≤ 1000.

Large dataset
-------------
| 2 ≤ **R** ≤ 10\ :sup:`9`.
| 2 ≤ **C** ≤ 10\ :sup:`9`.
